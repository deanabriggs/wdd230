            <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
            <p>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep
                the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if
                they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in
                a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true, for the Lord God
                hath spoken it.</p>

            <h2>Alma 41:10</h2>
            <p>Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to
                happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.</p>
